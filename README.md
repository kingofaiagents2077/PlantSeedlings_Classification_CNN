🌿 Plant Seedlings Classification with CNN

This deep learning project tackles a real-world agricultural challenge: identifying plant seedlings efficiently using computer vision. Manual sorting and identification of plants is time-consuming and labor-intensive — this CNN-based solution accelerates the process, offering improved scalability, accuracy, and sustainability.

## 🧠 Objective
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accurately classifies plant seedlings into 12 species based on image data.

## 📁 Dataset
- Provided by Aarhus University Signal Processing Group in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark.
- Consists of:
  - `images.npy`: Numpy array of image data.
  - `Labels.csv`: CSV file containing corresponding species labels.

Species in the dataset:
- Black-grass  
- Charlock  
- Cleavers  
- Common Chickweed  
- Common Wheat  
- Fat Hen  
- Loose Silky-bent  
- Maize  
- Scentless Mayweed  
- Shepherds Purse  
- Small-flowered Cranesbill  
- Sugar beet

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- OpenCV (optional)

## ✅ Outcomes
- Trained CNN model with high accuracy on test set
- Confusion matrix to visualize performance
- Business insights for agricultural automation

## 💡 Impact
By automating seedling classification, this model can help farmers make faster decisions, improve yield, and reduce manual labor — aiding in the shift toward sustainable agriculture.
